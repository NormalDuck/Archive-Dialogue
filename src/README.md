**A secure, lightweight, server-sided, Fusion-based module. **
## Features
* Server-Sided Listeners: 100% (hopefully) Realiable listeners for every tiny dialogue component.

* Built-In Anticheat: Reduces the possibilties for clients to abuse signals.
* Less Exposure of Data: When sending information to client, the signal will automatically remove information that is not needed. This can reduce the chances of clients to know the entire dialogue.

* ByteNet communication: Uses ByteNet for communication to reduce the bandwidth for networking.
